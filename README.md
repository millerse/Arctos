# Arctos

Interactions gathered from Arctos collection that will be available through Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI, http://globalbioticinteractions.org).

This dataset was created using the data from Arctos.  The data was gathered through searching the data for an interaction of value (x feeds on y, z interacts with q).  Thoses records that have valuable interactions were saved to be added to Globi.  There is a link to the origninal record in the interactions table for reference.
